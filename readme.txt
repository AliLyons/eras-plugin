Taylor Swift is not just an entertainer, she is a mastermind of global success.  This is not just a plugin, it's a celebration of some of her best lyrics.

== Description ==

Taylor Swift is a cultural phenomenon whose music catalog spans almost two decades. This plugin inserts random Taylor Swift lyrics from various eras of her career, up until TTPD (The Tortured Poets Department).  Make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it!

This plugin is heavily inspired by, and forked from, Matt Mullenweg's Hello Dolly plugin.
